        Provides a backend-independent persistence abstraction.

        Currently this package provides two implementenations of the
        high-level persistence layer:
        <ol>
            <li><b>NoDB:</b> Only reads patterns and permissions from the respective xml-files and provides no storage at all. </li>
            <li><b>sql:</b> Provides reading of patterns and permissions from a SQL database as well as saving of results.</li>
        </ol>
