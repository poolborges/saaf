# What it this?
This is intended for developers and shows you how to use the build.xml file to deploy a snapshot-build.

# What is a snapshot-bulid?
A snapshot build is intended as a package that contains a runnable version of SAAF and all dependencies
based on the current version of the source code in your working copy

#What does it contain?
|____templates (folder containing reporting templates)
|		... 
|____jad (java decompiler binary)
|____lib (folder containing the dependencies needed to run saaf)
|		...
|____jad_linux_static (java decompiler static binary)
|____saaf.jar (SAAF itself)
|____doc (folder containing user documentation and a sample configuration file)
		...
|____smali-1.2.6.jar (smali binary used to decompile dex code)

#What should I do before creating a snapshot build?

1. make sure you have the latest code from the repository (svn update)
2. make sure your code actually builds
3. make sure ant knows that jsch (located in SAAF/lib/package folder) by adding it to ANT_HOME, 
passing it to ant via the -lib parameter or (if you use eclipse) by adding it to ants classpath:
Run->External Tools->External Tools Configuration->Classpath->Add JARs
4. make sure the ssh.identity is correct for your setup (it uses ~/.ssh/id_dsa

#How do I create the snapshot build?
Run the deploy-snapshot target in build.xml. Either by opening build.xml in the ant editor in eclipse 
and  right-click the deploy-snapshot target and run As -> ant build or by running ant in the project folder:

ant -lib lib/package/jsch-0.1.48.jar deploy-snapshot

If your public-key is NOT located at ~/.ssh/id_dsa you must start it (CAUTION: No space after -D):

ant -Dssh.identity=<path to your key> -lib lib/package/jsch-0.1.48.jar deploy-snapshot
