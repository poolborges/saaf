== Requirements ==
dot (optional) - to generate png files for control-flow graphs
ssdeep (optional) - to generate fuzzy hashing signatures
jad (optional) - to decompile the apk to java code
mysql-server (tested on 5.5)

1. Extract the SAAF-*.tar.gz (you obviously did this already)
2. Adjust the configuration to your needs:

#### The conf directory ####

All configuration of SAAF is done in the conf directory. You can find several files here:

conf/
├── AdNetworks.xml (contains the package paths that are treated as belonging to an ad-framework)
├── backtracking-patterns.xml (contains the specifications of methods that are considered during program slicing)
├── heuristic-patterns.xml (contains the patterns that are used for quick-checks)
├── log4j.properties (contains the logging configuration)
├── permissions.xml (contains the permissions that are known to SAAF)
└── schema (contains xml-schema files used to validate the xml files. Mostly interesting if you want to write your own patterns)
    ├── AdNetworks.xsd
    ├── backtracking-patterns.xsd
    ├── heuristic-patterns.xsd
    └── permissions.xsd
└── saaf.conf (the main configuration file. The following sections relate to this file)

#### Setting up the Database ####

By default SAAF does not store its results in a database.
Create a database and a user for SAAF in your mysql (the user needs full privileges on the database)
We assume you are familiar with setting up a database and user in MySQL.
Make sure to set db.disable=false  in the configuration file.
Then configure SAAF for MySQL by uncommenting and editing the lines with db.* 

#### Setting up external programs ####
Once you installed the external programs referred to in Requirements, go to the saaf.conf
and adjust the values beginning with external.

#### Setting up viewers ####
To view the generated control flow graphs (PNG images) from the GUI adjust viewer.images to a program of your choice
To view the xml reports from the GUI adjsut viewer.reports to a program of your choice
